# Ship of Thesis
The idea of PhD is to push the boundary of the human knowledge. Few years are spent doing the research and the findings are documented in a dissertation/PhD thesis. At the end of the PhD, thesis becomes a static document, holding the essence of someone's research during thier PhD. Further, many of the databases of PhD theses are paywalled. And these are the two big motivations for this project, the Ship of Thesis. Though, a long list of the reasons is given below.
# The idea!
Here, we aim to create a central and crowd-sourced database of PhD theses. The author of the thesis will create a github repository with their thesis and supplementary material. The details of the thesis and the link to the github repository could then be submitted to this repository. The details for submission are presented here.
# Motivations for the Ship of Thesis.
* **Clickety stuff** The thesis is a static document on so many levels. One of which is there is absolutely no links except for the internal links to equations and references. By having a github repository, you can have direct links to the articles you are referring. Plus, you can include links to both the arxiv version and the published version.
* **Animations** This is a continuation of the above point. Now, your thesis lives on github, which means you can make your thesis interactive. No more boring graphs and static picture. You could have animations and widgets. Infact, you could have a jupyter notebook version of your thesis.
* **Crowd sourcing**
* **Time evolution**
* **Forward and backward references**
* **Version control**
* **Time evolution of the field**
* **Switching directions**
* **Open questions**
